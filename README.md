# Production_PL

Small Python project for production planning and solving tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python program with a solver and a UI layer. It is intended as an entry-level project to run and inspect the solver logic.

## Files

- `main.py` — Program entrypoint; starts the application.
- `solver.py` — Core solving logic and algorithms.
- `ui.py` — User interface helpers (CLI or GUI wrapper).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (Windows instructions shown below).
- No external dependencies are assumed; if your project uses packages, add a `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup (Windows)

1. Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Run

Run the application from the project root:

```powershell
python main.py
```
